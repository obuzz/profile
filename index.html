    <h2>Adventures To Date</h2>
      <h3><strong><a href="https://thevinmen.wordpress.com/">Driving to Mongolia | The Vin Men</strong><a/></h3>
        <p>In 2015 Bruce Blackwell and I embarked on a 26,000km drive to Mongolia in a 1970's ex-British Army Landrover, along the way we promoted Australian wine from the Barossa Valley and raised money for Prostate Cancer Research. <strong><a href="https://thevinmen.wordpress.com/">Read more about this adventure here...</strong></a></p>
      <h3><strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/132482854@N06/18771326765">Sailing Across The Atlantic</a></strong></h3>
        <p>Between April and June 2015 I was part of a crew of seven that set sail to cross the Atlantic from Tortola in the British Virgin Islands to the Azores - 3400nm away. Along the way our Captain fell ill, we encountered violent squalls and swam in the ocean thousands of miles from shore.  <strong><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/132482854@N06/18771326765">To see some photos from the trip click here...</strong></a></p>
      <h3><strong><a href="https://twoontoursite.wordpress.com/welcome-to-two-on-tour/">Cycling 8600kms from London to Tibilsi in Georgia</a></strong></h3>
        <p>In April 2017 my wife and I set off on a bike ride to cross Europe and reach the Caucasus Mountains. We cycled the great rivers of Europe, mountains in the Balkans and Turkey and encountered amazing people and places along the way. <strong><a href="https://twoontoursite.wordpress.com/welcome-to-two-on-tour/">Read more about this adventure here
